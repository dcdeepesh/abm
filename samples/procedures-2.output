Consider the CALLER the routine which is calling the CALLEE

Before 'foo', r is:
2
-------------------------------------
'p' is a formal parameter and 'r' is an actual parameter,
therefore the call may be seen as 'foo(r)'.
And procedure 'foo' may be seen as 'foo(int p)'.
-------------------------------------
In 'foo', 'r' is local. Therefore 'r' is:
0
In callee 'foo', the value of 'p' is:
2
-------------------------------------
Value of 'p' in caller function is:
0
